ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Bartek, I aspire to be a Frontend Developer.
I'm learning how to create what i actually imagined.

Frontend:
âœ” - HTML & CSS & SCSS + bootstrap/MUI âœ” - JavaScript ES6 âœ” - GIT/Github âœ” - React
Backend:
âœ” Firebase

In my learning queue are:
Node.js + express.js and MongoDB.

Years ago, i created website using php and SQL so i know something about that.
